            "description": "Travis is striding briskly across Broadway toward the Palantine Headquarters.He's dressed the best we have seen him; his pants (not jeans) are pressed,\n his boots shined, his hair combed. Under his Army jacket he wears a freshly laundered shirt and ivy league tie. He drops his cigarette, steps on it and walks in.\n Watching Travis enter Palantine's Headquarters, we are surprised to realize that Travis is really quite attractive. His deformities are psychological, not physical. He believes he is cursed, and therefore he is.\nTravis walks briskly into the office, and heads toward Betsy's desk.  Tom walks over to greet him, but Travis ignores him.\nAs the CAMERA examines Travis' face more closely, one can see the hollowness wrought by lack of sleep and sufficient diet.\nBETSY waves TOM off with a short gesture, indicating everything is OK.  He walks away.\nBetsy is interviewing Travis, but she is also teasing him a little, leading him on in a gentle feminine way.\nTravis is pacing back and forth on Broadway just beyond the Palantine Headquarters. He checks his watch.\n\n",
